The overture map data project was launched by the Linus Foundation in 2022. It's goal is to create a geospatial data product that is easy-to-use and interoperable, merging the datasets from both open and commercial data contributors. The list of Overture members is long and includes many of the industryâ€™s biggest players, like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and TomTom. Now they are teaming up with open data projects to create a larger and more consistent geospatial dataset than ever before.
